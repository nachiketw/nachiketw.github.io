I'm currently studying Aeronautical & Astronautical Engineering at Purdue University. My hobbies include producing electronic music and financial modeling.

I'm passionate about entrepreneurship, and about rapid R&D that pushes the cutting edge.

### What you'll find here

I'm a curious person, and I like to explore ideas. This blog is an attempt to document those explorations on 'paper', which will help me engage with them on a deeper level.
